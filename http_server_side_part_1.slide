* Introduction

- Golang has really mature and high level api for HTTP.
- Even supports HTTP/2.


* Philosophy

Developers in golang prefer to write their application from scratch.
They prefer not to rely on frameworks. We will "try" to follow this
Philosophy.

* HTTP

- Text based protocol
- Uses TCP
- Stateless
- Request Response Model

* HTTP 1.1 Improvements

- Persistent Connections (single connection for multiple Request-Response)
- Http Pipelining (FIFO model)
- Chunk Transfer Encoding (Streaming insted of buffering)

* Advantages of HTTP 1.1

- Reduce network congestion (fewer TCP connections)
- Reduce latency in subsequent request (no handshaking)
- Lower CPU and memory usage (fewer connections open simultaneously)
- Better performance for HTTPS connection which require much more CPU time and network round-trips

* HTTP Server Components

- Router
- HTTP protocol implementation
- Templating
- Middleware (More of a convinience)

* Basic HTTP Building Blocks

- Use the standard library for as long as possible
- You may not need an external package at all
- Use http.Handler and http.HandlerFunc

  type Handler interface {
    ServeHTTP(ResponseWriter, *Request)
  }

  type HandlerFunc func(ResponseWriter, *Request)

  // ServeHTTP calls f(w, r).
  func (f HandlerFunc) ServeHTTP(w ResponseWriter, r *Request) {
    f(w, r)
  }

Remember this signature

  func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)

* http.ResponseWriter

  // A ResponseWriter interface is used by an HTTP handler to
  // construct an HTTP response.
  type ResponseWriter interface {
    Header() Header
    Write([]byte) (int, error)
    WriteHeader(int)
  }

* http.Request

http.Request contains everything you need to know about the request.

- `r.Method` - HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` etc.)
- `r.URL.Path` - Request path (`/things/123`)
- `r.URL.String()` - Full URL
- `r.URL.Query()` - Query parameters (q=something&p=2)
- `r.Body` - `io.ReadCloser` of the request body

* Routing

- GET /person -> handlePerson

  http.handleFunc("/", handleIndex)
  http.handleFunc("/time", handleTime)
  http.handleFunc("/person", handlePerson)

Gotchas:

- / matches *eveything*
- No path variable parsing
- No pattern matching
- One handler for every HTTP method
- SubRouting not supported

* If you want parametric routes use `gorrila-mux`

    r := mux.NewRouter()
    r.HandleFunc("/products/{key}", ProductHandler)
    r.HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/", ArticlesCategoryHandler)
    r.HandleFunc("/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}", ArticleHandler)

* Simple Web Server

.code /assets_http/code/httpServer.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/


* Middlewares

- Run a code before and after the handler code
- Single responsibility
- Pluggable and self-contained
- Just another layer in your request handling cycle

Go's `net/http` package functions `StripPrefix` & `TimeoutHandler`
are exaclty what we define as middlewares

  func StripPrefix(prefix string, h Handler) Handler

  func TimeoutHandler(h Handler, dt time.Duration, msg string) Handler


* Writing Middleware in Go

.code /assets_http/code/middlewarePattern.go /^type Middleware/,/^}/
.code /assets_http/code/middlewarePattern.go /^func ComposeMiddleWare/,/^}/

* Cont ...

How it all fits together

.code /assets_http/code/middlewarePattern.go /^func main/,/^}/


* Advance Middlewares Goals (Post Middlewares)

The Problem:

- Calling `Write()` before handler, handler will lose control over status code, since the first `Write()` writes them out immediately.
- Modifying the original output, i.e replacing strings in it.
- Changing response status code: when the wrapped handler returns

Solution:

- Buffered Response Writer
- Ability to record mutations for later use or inspection

* Meet ResponseRecorder

Definition: ResponseRecorder is an implementation of http.ResponseWriter that records its mutations for later inspection in tests.

.code /assets_http/code/httpResponseRecorder.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Exercises

* Add a http Auth to this simple reverse proxy application.

.link /assets_http/code/httpProxy.go httpProxy

Snippets

      # to show basic auth window.
      w.Header().Set("WWW-Authenticate", "Basic realm=\"user\"")
      http.Error(w, http.StatusText(http.StatusUnauthorized), http.StatusUnauthorized)

NOTE - The `Authorization` header has the basic auth

    # to decode a base64 string
    base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString

* Create a login screen

* Middleware

- Create a middleware to support HTTP methods (GET,POST,PUT etc)

Desired Result

  post := RequestMethodMiddleware("POST")
  get := RequestMethodMiddleware("GET")
  myHandlerGet := get(myHandler)
  myHandlerPost := post(myHandler)
  http.Handle("/postEndPoint", myHandlerPost)
  http.Handle("/getEndPoint", myHandlerGet)
